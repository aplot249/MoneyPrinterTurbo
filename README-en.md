## Installation & Deployment üì•

It is recommended to create a Python virtual environment
using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo.git
cd MoneyPrinterTurbo
conda create -n MoneyPrinterTurbo python=3.10
conda activate MoneyPrinterTurbo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- Try to avoid using **Chinese paths** to prevent unpredictable issues
- Ensure your **network** is stable, meaning you can access foreign websites normally

#### ‚ë† Install ImageMagick

##### Windows:

- Download https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.1-29-Q16-x64-static.exe
- Install the downloaded ImageMagick, do not change the installation path

##### MacOS:

```shell
brew install imagemagick
````

##### Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

##### CentOS

```shell
sudo yum install ImageMagick
```

#### ‚ë° Modify the Configuration File

- Copy the `config.example.toml` file and rename it to `config.toml`
- Follow the instructions in the `config.toml` file to configure `pexels_api_keys` and `llm_provider`, and according to
  the llm_provider's service provider, set up the corresponding API Key
- If it's a `Windows` system, `imagemagick_path` is your actual installation path (if you didn't change the path during
  installation, just uncomment it)

#### ‚ë¢ Configure Large Language Models (LLM)

- To use `GPT-4.0` or `GPT-3.5`, you need an `API Key` from `OpenAI`. If you don't have one, you can set `llm_provider`
  to `g4f` (a free-to-use GPT library https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free)
- Alternatively, you can apply at [Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.cn/console/api-keys). Register to get 15 yuan of
  trial money, which allows for about 1500 conversations. Then set `llm_provider="moonshot"` and `moonshot_api_key`.
  Thanks to [@jerryblues](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/8) for the suggestion

### Launch the Web Interface üåê

Note that you need to execute the following commands in the `root directory` of the MoneyPrinterTurbo project

#### Windows

```bat
conda activate MoneyPrinterTurbo
webui.bat
```

#### MacOS or Linux

```shell
conda activate MoneyPrinterTurbo
sh webui.sh
```

After launching, the browser will open automatically

The effect is shown in the following image:
![](docs/webui-en.jpg)

### Launch the API Service üöÄ

```shell
python main.py
```

After launching, you can view the `API documentation` at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs and directly test the interface
online for a quick experience.

The effect is shown in the following image:
![](docs/api.jpg)

## Voice Synthesis üó£

A list of all supported voices can be viewed here: [Voice List](./docs/voice-list.txt)

## Subtitle Generation üìú

Currently, there are 2 ways to generate subtitles:

- edge: Faster generation speed, better performance, no specific requirements for computer configuration, but the
  quality may be unstable
- whisper: Slower generation speed, poorer performance, specific requirements for computer configuration, but more
  reliable quality

You can switch between them by modifying the `subtitle_provider` in the `config.toml` configuration file

It is recommended to use `edge` mode, and switch to `whisper` mode if the quality of the subtitles generated is not
satisfactory.

> If left blank, it means no subtitles will be generated.

## Background Music üéµ

Background music for videos is located in the project's `resource/songs` directory.
> The current project includes some default music from YouTube videos. If there are copyright issues, please delete
> them.

## Subtitle Fonts üÖ∞

Fonts for rendering video subtitles are located in the project's `resource/fonts` directory, and you can also add your
own fonts.

## Common Questions ü§î

### ‚ùìRuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found

Normally, ffmpeg will be automatically downloaded and detected.
However, if your environment has issues preventing automatic downloads, you may encounter the following error:

```
RuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found.
Install ffmpeg on your system, or set the IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE environment variable.
```

In this case, you can download ffmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/, unzip it, and set `ffmpeg_path` to your
actual installation path.

```toml
[app]
# Please set according to your actual path, note that Windows path separators are \\
ffmpeg_path = "C:\\Users\\harry\\Downloads\\ffmpeg.exe"
```

### ‚ùìError generating audio or downloading videos

[issue 56](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/56)

```
failed to generate audio, maybe the network is not available. 
if you are in China, please use a VPN.
```

[issue 44](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/44)

```
failed to download videos, maybe the network is not available. 
if you are in China, please use a VPN.
```

This is likely due to network issues preventing access to foreign services. Please use a VPN to resolve this.

### ‚ùìImageMagick is not installed on your computer

[issue 33](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/33)

1. Follow the `example configuration` provided `download address` to
   install https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.1-29-Q16-x64-static.exe, using the static library
2. Do not install in a path with Chinese characters to avoid unpredictable issues

[issue 54](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/54#issuecomment-2017842022)

For Linux systems, you can manually install it, refer to https://cn.linux-console.net/?p=16978
